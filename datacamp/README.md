# Datacamp Exercises Codebase

This repository contains a collection of exercises and code snippets created while taking various courses on [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). The goal of this codebase is to serve as a reference and learning resource for concepts covered in the courses.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the topics or tools covered in the exercises. Each directory contains scripts and files relevant to the specific topic.

### Example Structure:
```

```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/datacamp-exercises.git
   cd datacamp-exercises
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired topic directory and explore the scripts.

3. Run the Python scripts to see the examples in action:
   ```bash
   python path/to/script.py
   ```

## Topics Covered

- **Python Basics**: Variables, loops, functions, and other foundational Python concepts.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating plots using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and clustering.
- **Deep Learning**: Building neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
